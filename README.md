# Ansible

This repository serves as my personal Ansible collection and playground. It contains various Ansible roles, playbooks, and configurations that I use for testing, learning, and automating tasks.

## Setting up the Environment

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment on macOS/Linux/WSL:
      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now you are ready to use the Ansible collection and begin working with the playbooks and roles in this repository.
